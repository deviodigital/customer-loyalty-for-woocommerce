# Customer Loyalty for WooCommerce®

Brought to you by [Devio Digital](https://deviodigital.com/)

The **Customer Loyalty for WooCommerce®** plugin helps retain customers by rewarding them for repeat purchases with a customizable loyalty points system and rewards card functionality.

## Rewards Card

CLWC provides a **Rewards Card** feature that allows you to create a virtual **punch card** for customers. After accumulating a specified number of "punches," customers receive a coupon code as a reward.

### Rewards Card Features

- **Customizable Appearance**: Set custom titles, text, and images for the rewards card.
- **Coupon Rewards**: Define the coupon amount, choose between flat rate or percentage discounts, and add a custom prefix to generated coupon codes.
- **Punch Tracking**: Track the number of punches required to redeem a reward, encouraging customers to complete repeat purchases.

## Loyalty Points System

CLWC includes a comprehensive **Loyalty Points** system, allowing customers to earn points for completing predefined tasks. Points can be redeemed for discounts through coupons, enhancing customer engagement and repeat business.

### Loyalty Points Features

- **Points for Actions**: Reward points for specific actions such as account registration, order completion, and spending per dollar.
- **Redemption Requirements**: Set a minimum number of points required to redeem rewards, and define the coupon amount when points are redeemed.
- **Flexible Rewards**: Configure point values per dollar spent, giving customers an incentive to make larger purchases.

## Points Management and Log Table

CLWC includes an admin **Points Management Table** for viewing, adjusting, and tracking each customer's loyalty points. Administrators can manually adjust points as needed, with any changes being recorded in a **Loyalty Log Table** to track point adjustments and rewards.

### Points Management Table Features

- **Customer Overview**: View each customer's name, email, and current points.
- **Manual Adjustment**: Directly adjust points for each customer in the admin area.
- **Automatic Logging**: When points are adjusted manually, a log entry is created, noting the admin user who made the change and the point difference (e.g., `+100` or `-50`).

### Loyalty Log Table Features

- **Detailed Logs**: Each log entry includes the customer's name, email, points earned or redeemed, and a description of the action taken.
- **Admin Tracking**: Tracks which administrator adjusted points, along with the exact number of points added or removed.
- **Redemption History**: Records redemption actions, showing how many points were redeemed and the corresponding coupon value.

## Database Tables

Two main database tables are created to manage loyalty functionality:

1. **CLWC Loyalty Log Table**: Stores each loyalty event, including user ID, points awarded or deducted, details, and timestamp.
2. **CLWC Points Table**: Tracks each customer's current point balance, enabling efficient management and updates from the admin interface.
